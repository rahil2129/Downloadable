 + Whitelisted "constant" PHP function in XSL to be able to retrieve constant values for usage in PHP function calls in arguments

===== 2.10.8 =====
 + Added ability to export each file generated by profiles as a separate email. If your export profile generates 5 files (or if "Export each object separately" is enabled), this would lead to 5 emails being sent, with each email having just one attachment.
 + Added ability to export URLs to files uploaded by customers using our "Order/Customer Attributes" extension for orders. Node in XML: xtento_customattributes_order_files
 + Added ability to export files uploaded by customers using our "Order/Customer Attributes" extension for orders to your destinations. See: https://support.xtento.com/wiki/Magento_2_Extensions:Magento_Order_Export_Module#Exporting_files_uploaded_by_customers_using_the_XTENTO_Custom_Attributes_extension

 * Fixed issue for PHP 7.2 & Test XSL Template functionality

===== 2.11.0 =====

 * Fixed an error when using the CLI commands xtento:orderexport:config:export and xtento:orderexport:config:import

===== 2.11.2 =====
 + Added further FTP compatibility feature: "Ignore IP returned by server in passive mode" - If enabled in the FTP destination, the (local) IP address returned by the FTP server will be ignored (useful for servers behind NAT) and instead the servers public IP address will be used. Can help with "Operation now in progress" errors or other directory listing/transfer issues.

===== 2.11.3 =====
 + Image links and product links of items ordered by customers can now be exported, with the "correct" store URL
 * Fixed a potential security issue: Reflected XSS via GET parameters in backend/manual export area. If "Add secret keys to URLs" is enabled in the backend (which should hopefully always be the case!) this should have been nearly impossible to exploit though.

===== 2.11.4 =====
 + Added ability to export order attribute data stored by Mageplaza Order Attributes

===== 2.11.5 =====

===== 2.12.2 =====
 + Date/time filters such as "Date From/To", "Older than X minutes" can now be used with profiles that use event exports

===== 2.12.3 =====
 + Added ability to specify a different "From name" for email destinations (right now, from name was always the from email)
 * Fixed an issue where mass downloads in execution log throw an exception if files have been deleted in the meantime

===== 2.12.4 =====
 * Email destinations: Fixed "utf8" encoded recipient/from names are double encoded. Should display properly now.

 + Added ability to export more data about "assignations" (warehouse/POS location) stored by Wyomind Advanced Inventory extension

===== 2.12.6 =====

 * Fixed an issue for email destinations where emails didn't arrive in case a space was mistakenly entered in the email address
 * Fixed an issue for email destinations where the date/time was wrong for variables in subject/body (timezone issue)
 * For manual exports, if both date range filter AND  "created during last X days" filter is used, the date range filter now is applied instead of "created during last x days" as it does not make sense to combine those, and date range is more important.

===== 2.13.2 =====
 * Established compatibility with Magento 2.4.0 and 2.3.5-p2
 * Established compatibility with PHP 7.4, dropped support for PHP 5.x
 * Updated Xtento_XtCore to version 2.10.0
 + Added uninstall script so bin/magento module:uninstall removes database tables

===== 2.13.7 =====
 + Improved error handler for crashes: A notification email is now sent if "debug emails" are enabled and an error has been logged

===== 2.13.8 =====
 * Fixed an issue when changing the order status: If the status one tries to set is assigned to multiple order states, the state of the current order will be selected if possible (instead of another state eventually)

===== 2.13.9 =====
